# LaTeHub theme for Typora

This project aims to create a similar look and feel to LaTeX documents by modifying the default [Typora](https://typora.io/) theme "Github" (thus LaTeHub). I simply needed a theme that looked nice when exported and also justified the text. So far, only minor changes have been made. These include:

- replaced the default font with CMU Serif (Czech localization)
- added `text-align: justify` to `body` in the CSS file



Here is a screenshot of the theme:

Everything else (code blocks, math blocks, images ...) works the same as the default Typora theme.


### Installation

Download the zip file from the [realeases page](https://github.com/rnd195/LaTeHubTheme-Typora/releases/) and paste the `latehub.css` and the `latehub` folder into your Typora theme location. For Windows users, it is located by default in "C:\Users\\**YourUsername**\AppData\Roaming\Typora\themes" ([see official instructions](https://support.typora.io/About-Themes/)).


### Additional information

The author of the used CMU Serif font is [Andrey V. Panov](http://canopus.iacp.dvo.ru/%7Epanov/cm-unicode/).
