# LaTeHub theme for Typora

This project aims to create a similar look and feel to LaTeX documents by modifying the default Typora theme "Github" (thus LaTeHub). I simply needed a theme that looked nice when exported and also justified the text. So far, only minor changes have been made. These include:

- replaced the default font with CMU Serif (Czech localization)
- added `text-align: justify` to `body` in the CSS file



Here is a screenshot of the theme:

### Installation

Download the zip file from the [realeases page](https://github.com/rnd195/LaTeHubTheme-Typora/releases/) and paste the `latehub.css` and the `latehub` folder ainto your Typora theme location. It is located by default in C:\Users\\**YourUsername**\AppData\Roaming\Typora\themes.
